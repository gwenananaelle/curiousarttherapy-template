							No artistic experience is necessary for this art-based psychotherapy. As children we
							all were multi-talented artists; as adults we all have a creative side waiting to be
							awakened and challenged. Together, at your pace, we will draw, paint, collage, write,
							sing imagine, break, build, repair, craft, conceptualize or dance what your mind
							imagines and what your body feels.

						But art therapy is much more than just making art, it is also a dialogue, the
						opportunity to question, to reframe and give meaning. The art therapy studio or online
						session is a safe space to share the thoughts associated with the creative process, a
						great revelator of our inner self. Often, seeing in 2 or 3D something we only considered
						with the mind or heart, permits a change in perspective, a breakthrough. With the
						support of the therapist, one can then engage in symbolic rituals to edit, transform,
						contain, or sometimes erase what is necessary for our evolution. These experiences can
						be very liberating and offer renewed insight into ourselves and our relationships,
						empowering us to take important decisions.

					Art therapy is a recognized form of mental health care, practiced in hospitals and mental
					health clinics worldwide. The latest research in neuroscience highlights the potential for
					art-based interventions in helping with trauma, depression and loss, as well as with
					chronic illnesses such as cancer. Somatic psychology strengthens the importance of
					involving the body, as in art making, to effectively rewire the brain for increased
					resilience and trauma resolution.

					Art therapy is a regulated and evidence-based mental health profession. Becoming an art
					therapist requires a master’s level education, completion of thousands of hours of
					supervised clinical work, and commitment to ongoing continuing education. In the United
					States, art therapists also hold a professional counseling or Marriage and family therapy
					license, ensuring the highest standards of ethical and clinical practice. The field of art
					therapy is supported by a growing body of scientific studies and clinical trials across
					multiple areas of healthcare, including cancer care, post-traumatic stress disorder
					(PTSD), Parkinson’s disease, addiction recovery, and pain management. These studies
					demonstrate its impact on reducing distress, enhancing coping, and improving quality of
					life. To learn more about art therapy, its applications, and its professional standards,
