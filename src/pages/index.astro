						<p>No artistic experience is necessary for this art-based psychotherapy.  As children we all were multi-talented artists; as adults we all have a creative side waiting to be awakened and challenged.  Together, at your pace, we will draw, paint, collage, write, sing or dance what your mind imagines and what your body feels.</p>

						<p>But art therapy is much more than just making art, it is also a dialogue, the opportunity to question, to reframe and give meaning.  The art therapy studio or online session is a safe space to share the thoughts associated with the creative process, a great revelator of our inner self. Often, seeing in 2 or 3D something we only considered with the mind or heart, permits a change in perspective, a breakthrough. With the support of the therapist, one can then engage in symbolic rituals to edit, transform, contain, or sometimes erase what is necessary for our evolution. These experiences can be very liberating and offer renewed insight into ourselves and our relationships, empowering us to take important decisions.</p>

						<p>Art therapy is a recognized form of mental health care, practiced in hospitals and mental health clinics worldwide. The latest research in neuroscience highlights the potential for art-based interventions in helping with trauma, depression and loss, as well as with chronic illnesses such as cancer.  Somatic psychology strengthens the importance of involving the body, as in art making, to effectively rewire the brain for increased resilience and trauma resolution.</p>
