						We all share a natural right to self-realization and fulfillment, whether in our
						relationships, our work, or the way we move through life. As children, we were all
						artists. We expressed joy and sorrow through drawings, dances, play, music, and
						spontaneous imagination. For many of us, these creative impulses were later set aside,
						silenced, or suppressed. In art therapy, we return to this innate capacity for
						expression. Through playful techniques, drawing inspiration from science, literature,
						mechanics, and everyday life, we tap into your creative energy and imagination. Each
						session unfolds uniquely, guided by your needs while simultaneously documented and
						embodied through both the artwork you create and the reflections, emotions, and
						associations that emerge. At times, I create alongside you. This shared making is not to
						guide or correct, but to accompany, to hold space and foster connection. My role is
						always to support your self-expression with care, curiosity, and attentiveness, so that
						you may discover new insights, release emotions, and experience your creativity as a
						resource for growth and resilience
