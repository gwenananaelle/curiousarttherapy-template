						Life is marked by important transitions, birth, puberty, coming of age, graduation,
						engagement, marriage, divorce, loss, death, grief... Each of these moments deserves to
						be honored in a way that feels authentic and meaningful. As an art therapist and
						celebrant, I help individuals and families design personalized rituals and ceremonies
						that reflect your cultural heritage, beliefs, and values. These can be simple or
						elaborate, secular or spiritual, traditional, or entirely new. What matters most is that
						they resonate with you and your loved ones. Together, we can weave creative expressions
						and symbolic actions, such as collaborative art-making, poetry, music, or nature-based
						gestures, into these ceremonies. These elements offer not only beauty, but also healing,
						connection, and a deeper sense of belonging. Whether you wish to celebrate a joyful
						milestone or to honor a difficult passage, I will support you in creating a ceremony
						that is inclusive, original, and deeply personal. Let us celebrate together and
						transform lifeâ€™s transitions into meaningful memories that endure
