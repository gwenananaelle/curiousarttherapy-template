We all have a right to self-realization and fulfillment, whether in our relationships or in our work. As children, we were all artists, expressing joy and sorrow through drawings, dances, stories, and improvised music. For many of us, these natural forms of self-expression were eventually silenced, set aside, or suppressed altogether.
In art therapy, we reawaken that creative energy. Through playful techniques and inspiration drawn from science, literature, mechanics, and the arts, we explore your imagination as a resource for growth and healing. Each session is unique and leaves a tangible trace through your artwork and the emotional and cognitive associations that emerge from it. Sometimes I create alongside you, modeling openness and curiosity, while always keeping the focus on your experience. My role is to support you in giving form to what is felt but not yet spoken, helping you reflect, gain insight, and discover new possibilities for expression and resilience.
As a person centered therapist informed by critical theory, I believe deeply in our innate capacity to heal, adapt, and move toward growth when we are given the right conditions. Healthy environments where our individuality is respected and our voices are encouraged are essential for this process. In therapy, we strive to create such spaces together: places where creativity can flourish and where you are supported in becoming more fully yourself.
