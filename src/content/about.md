### Hello, Hola, Bonjour!

Hello, Hola, Bonjour!
My name is Marie, and I’m here to gently guide you on a creative and healing journey. Born and raised in Europe and having lived in several countries, I am now based in Houston (USA), where I work as a practicing artist and provisionally licensed art therapist and counselor (LPC-A, ATR-P). I support children, adolescents, and adults navigating challenging life transitions, grief, serious illness, and neurodivergence.<br>
I hold a Ph.D. in Expressive Therapies from Lesley University (USA) and a Master’s in Counseling and Art Therapy from Edgewood College (USA). My intensive clinical training in psycho-oncology, palliative care, and pain psychology included work with children and adults at the General Hospital in Mexico City (2019–2020) and at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston (2024–2025). An innovator, I created Icanfeel, a symptom-expression software currently in clinical trial at MD Anderson, where I collaborate with physicians and patients to explore how art can function as a non-verbal language for those living with cancer or in palliative care. My work bridges the worlds of art, science, and technology, expanding the ways people can express, heal, and be understood.<br>

Alongside my clinical practice, I teach at the Instituto Mexicano de Psicoterapia de Arte (IMPA) and serve as a visiting scholar at The New School University in New York, where I research the applications of AI in mental health. I am part of the leadership team of Expressive Arts Without Borders, and an active member of both the American Art Therapy Association and the Sociedad Latinamericana de Pediatría Oncológica (SLAOP). My commitment to social justice and inclusion informs my clinical work and global collaborations, ensuring that creative care remains accessible across cultures and communities.<br>

Before becoming an art therapist, I studied Public Affairs and Governance at the London School of Economics and Sciences Po Paris (Master level) and worked in both the corporate and NGO sectors. These experiences shaped my lifelong dedication to justice, equity, and ecological responsibility.<br>

A polymath at heart, I draw upon my diverse background to weave metaphors and images that invite reflection, imagination, and transformation.
I look forward to meeting you
