My artistic journey began with five years of training in oil painting in Paris under the mentorship of Patrice de Pracontal at Atelier de Recherche Picturale. Later, in Barcelona, I joined Studio Nomada, where I expanded into contemporary approaches, graffiti, and performance art. In Mexico, I was able to expand into clay work and ritual installations, inspired by Oaxaca, my husband’s hometown where I regularly collaborate with local artists and craftswomen.

A highlight of my practice is live painting with music, translating sound into color and gesture in real time. I have performed this at concerts and recently brought it into the hospital setting through a collaboration with the Neurosurgery Department at MD Anderson Cancer Center, as part of their Music and Medicine series. There, I invite both patients and audiences to join me in live painting, transforming music into collective visual expression.

Beyond painting, I create sculptures, fabric art, and works on found objects and canvases, always exploring materiality as a metaphor for resilience and transformation. Writing and spoken word performance are also integral to my practice, where I weave words and images into immersive storytelling.
I believe that creative expression is our universal birthright. Technique is not necessary to share one’s unique perception or contribute to collective culture; our sensibility and voice can emerge in many forms, on canvas, with natural or recycled materials, or even through the movement of our own bodies.
