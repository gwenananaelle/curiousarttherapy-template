title: Children
---

When engaging children in an art psychotherapy session, their imagination, their games and dreams become the language of our conversation.
Mixing playing and art making, in a safe environment, the child opens about how she/he perceives the world and the adult therapist can help him/her make sense of it. This unique method reduces the asymmetry in knowledge and power between child and adult, art as a healthy and dynamic transitional space.
Happy to talk on how to accompany your child in his/her questions and transitions
