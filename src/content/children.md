title: Children
---

When engaging children in an art psychotherapy session, their imagination, their games and dreams become the language of our conversation.
Mixing playing and art making, in a safe environment, the child opens about how she/he perceives the world and the adult therapist can help him/her make sense of it. This unique method reduces the asymmetry in knowledge and power between child and adult, art as a healthy and dynamic transitional space.
Happy to talk on how to accompany your child in his/her questions and transitions

When engaging children in an art psychotherapy session, their imagination, games, and dreams become the language of our conversation. Through a combination of play and art making in a safe and supportive environment, children are able to express how they see and experience the world. The therapist then helps them give meaning to these expressions and gently connects them to their emotions, relationships, and daily challenges.
This unique method lessens the imbalance of knowledge and power that often exists between child and adult, allowing art to serve as a healthy and dynamic bridge between inner experience and outer expression. It is a space where children can test ideas, build confidence, and discover new ways of coping.
I would be glad to speak with you about how to accompany your child as they explore their questions, emotions, and stages of growth.
