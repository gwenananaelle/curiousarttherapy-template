Art therapy can be a gentle, original and inclusive way of celebrating major life events and transitions. Whether individually or in family, unique ceremonies and rituals can be designed, with or without spiritual references and always according to your beliefs and values. Letâ€™s celebrate together and create meaningful memories for you and your loved ones.
