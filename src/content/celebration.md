title: Celebration
---

Life offers many passages, each carrying its own depth and meaning. The first cry of a newborn, the shifts of adolescence, the beginnings of independence, and the moments of choosing or being chosen in love or companionship. There are times of migration and resettlement, moments of becoming part of a new community, or reclaiming one’s roots. We may mark changes in gender identity, the embrace of parenthood, the end of a relationship, the arrival of grief after loss, or the rituals of remembering those who came before us.
Every culture and family honors these passages in its own way. Some gather around food and music, others weave prayer or storytelling, some plant trees, walk in silence, or create art together. What matters is that the ritual feels authentic, rooted in your values, and meaningful for you and your loved ones.<br>

As an art therapist and celebrant, I accompany individuals and families in designing ceremonies that bring these moments to life through creativity and symbolic action. Together we may paint, write poetry, create music, weave natural materials, or craft collaborative pieces that hold memory and meaning. My role is to provide a safe, imaginative space where you can connect with your heritage, your beliefs, and your relationships, and translate them into rituals that are both healing and memorable.<br>

Whether celebrating a joyful milestone or holding space for grief, I will support you in shaping a ceremony that feels inclusive, original, and deeply personal—one that transforms life’s passages into experiences of connection and lasting meaning
